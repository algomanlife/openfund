## Unreleased

### Round 6 — full content-editing backstage + UI fixes per user review (2026-11-01)
- **feat(cms):** FA-side editing — changing the Persian value in Directus now changes the Persian page (locale.js restores from `ofCmsLandingFa`); EN values unaffected. Editing **any** landing/terminal text (incl. buttons, nav, hero, footer) in both languages is now live.
- **feat(cms):** content-editing UX — `ui_messages` gains `section` (17 fa-labeled page areas) + `label` (friendly editor name); 110 key strings tagged (`tag_sections.py`); raw translation tables hidden from the sidebar; collection icons/notes set. Data Studio sidebar: UI Messages / Navigation / Pages / Site Settings only.
- **feat(wallet):** landing "ورود با کیف پول وب۳" card now opens the real RainbowKit modal (`window.__ofOpenConnect`); the RK modal is translated to Persian (fa not a built-in RK locale — DOM tree-walk translator + RTL) and follows the app language.
- **fix(terminal):** market category pills re-render on language switch (were stuck in the boot language); EN labels capitalized (All/Crypto/Forex/Stocks/Indices/Commodities) — static + Directus updated.
- **feat(terminal):** status bar rebuilt Gains/Hyperliquid-style: live clock with proper half-hour timezone (UTC+4:30), terminal version, live-data status + api.gains.trade source, support link; DEMO badge and garbled copy removed.
- **fix(ui):** header language/theme toggles unified at exactly 32×32 on both pages (width overflow fixed via box-sizing + min-width).
- **feat(footer):** full bilingual office addresses (Shiraz + San Francisco), Persian in fa / English in en; «توسعه‌داده‌شده در سان‌فرانسیسکو».
- WalletConnect projectId still needed for the full remote wallet list (only injected wallets show without it).


### Directus backstage — CMS for landing + terminal (2026-11-01, branch `qwen/directus-cms`)
- **feat(cms):** Directus 11.9.1 (pinned) + PostgreSQL 17 as the official Openfund backstage — docker compose deployment (`infrastructure/directus/compose.yaml`) + verified no-Docker local path (Homebrew postgres, Node 22 runtime).
- **feat(cms):** structured content model: `ui_messages` (+fa/en translations), `navigation_items`, `pages` (SEO), `site_settings`; public read-only policy on **published** content only; no tokens in the frontend.
- **feat(cms):** idempotent schema + seed scripts (`apps/backstage/scripts/`) — imported the current wording: 484 ui_messages (298 landing + 186 terminal labels), 10 navigation items, 2 pages, site settings. Re-runs never overwrite editorial changes.
- **feat(cms):** typed client (`packages/cms-client`, bundled at `apps/web-react/src/cms/client.ts`) — ONE request for all published strings, 2.5 s hard timeout, **silent fallback** to the static translations.json when the backstage is down (site stays fully usable — tested).
- **feat(cms):** both React pages await the CMS fetch before the legacy runtime boots (`window.ofCmsLanding` / `window.ofCmsTerminal` bridges in locale.js / terminal.js); CORS enabled for :5173/:4173.
- **test:** end-to-end live edit verified on dev AND build: change a value in the Data Studio → refresh the React page → the change renders (landing + terminal); fallback verified with the backstage stopped.
- **docs:** new `docs/backstage/` (README, CONTENT_MODEL, LOCAL_SETUP, TRANSLATIONS, PERMISSIONS); TECH_STACK / README / FEATURE_STATUS / MIGRATION_STATUS updated.


### Round 5 — UI polish per user review (2026-11-01, live-verified)
- **fix(terminal):** Openfund "O" chart brand moved to the **bottom-left of the plot** (was inline with the BT/BTC-USD statusline row); hover still reveals "penfund" + "Chart by Openfund Data".
- **fix(terminal):** Vela attribution link removed from the chart face and relocated as a discreet "Charts by Vela ↗" credit in the chart bottom bar — visible on the same screen, per the Apache-2.0 NOTICE requirement.
- **fix(terminal):** header language (EN ◎) / theme (◐) toggle buttons unified at 32px, matching the other icon buttons.
- **fix(landing):** footer credits logos — the blanket dark-mode invert was scoped to the black Render logo only, so the **Gains logo now shows its true teal gradients** (previously inverted to pink/orange); light-mode double-invert preserved for true brand colors in both themes.
- **feat(landing):** wallet connect button now lives in the landing header (`#wallet-root` inside nav-actions, right after the "ورود به ترمینال" CTA) with the same RainbowKit modal as the terminal; label follows the app language.
- **feat(landing):** new open-source row at the very bottom — GitHub mark + "همیشه شفاف و منبع‌باز" + "برای توسعهٔ دست‌جمعی و نظارت مداوم کاربران" (fa/en), plus the FA-only line "اولین کسب‌وکار منبع‌باز ایرانی" (auto-hidden in EN).
- Verified live on dev :5173 and build :4173 (Playwright: O position, Vela credit relocation, CTA adjacency, FA-only visibility, full regression 18/18 + fonts audited as Irancell).

### React migration: interactivity parity + wallet (2026-10-31, branch `qwen/react-migration`)
- **feat(react):** React 19 + Vite + TypeScript shell (`apps/web-react`) with both pages live at `http://127.0.0.1:4173/react/` (hash routing `#/` + `#/terminal`); build output lands in repo-root `react/`.
- **feat(wallet):** RainbowKit 2.2 + wagmi + viem + TanStack Query — custom bilingual `ConnectButton.Custom` in the terminal header (Arbitrum Sepolia, connection only, no transactions). Falls back to injected connectors when `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` is unset (getDefaultConfig throws on an empty id).
- **fix(react):** legacy-runtime parity — working language/theme buttons, translations, RTL↔LTR and arrow glyphs in the React pages. Root causes: synthetic `DOMContentLoaded` must bubble (locale.js listens on window); StrictMode double-injection of legacy scripts (now once per page via window guard); RainbowKitProvider's `data-rk` wrapper around the whole app made the translator skip every node (provider now wraps only the wallet button); hash router hijacking in-page anchors (now intercepted, catch-all route added).
- **fix(react):** navigating between pages reloads the app (per-page StrictMode-safe reload timer) so the legacy runtime (Gains WS, intervals, Vela workspace) tears down cleanly.
- **test:** real-browser Playwright E2E — 18/18 functional checks green on dev :5173 and built :4173 (theme, lang/dir, arrows, anchors, market rows, workspace LTR + trade panel right, reload teardown).
- **docs:** README redesigned (gallery from the React app, product + funding-model intro, Mermaid architecture, 9-phase roadmap, tech registry); new `docs/architecture/TECH_STACK.md`; `docs/migration/MIGRATION_STATUS.md` phase-2a fixes recorded.

### Terminal polish round 2 (user review feedback)
- **feat(charts):** the chart is now the **full Vela workspace** (`layout:false` single-chart mode, bundled as `dist/assets/vela-workspace.global.min.js`): native topbar (symbol / timeframe / style / indicator picker), drawing toolbar, status line, bottom bar (clock, ranges), native symbol search with keyboard — replacing the custom chart toolbar entirely. Custom timeframe/indicator buttons removed.
- **fix(gains):** the live WebSocket now speaks the verified Gains protocol (`{op:...}` + mandatory `ping→pong` heartbeat + sequence-gap resubscribe). Previously it used the wrong op shape and never stayed subscribed — prices were static. Verified live: ~90 updates/s, 1803 updates in 20 s.
- **feat(terminal):** symbol switches made inside Vela's own search now sync the whole terminal (stats, order form, book) and vice-versa.
- **feat(terminal):** market dropdown redesigned (Hyperliquid-style): 5 columns (market / live price / 24h change / real funding / real open interest), live in-place price cells with tick flashes, keyboard navigation (⌘K, ↑↓, Enter, ⌘S favorite, Esc) and lazily-fetched 24h change per row.
- **feat(terminal):** real open interest (long/short from Gains metadata) now shown in the stats bar; order book rows animate (depth-bar transitions + mid-price tick flashes, dYdX/Hyperliquid-style).
- chore: removed the superseded core-only Vela bundle.


### Terminal — Vela × Gains (this branch)
- **feat(terminal):** replaced the lightweight-charts demo chart with a real **LuxAlgo Vela** chart (`@luxalgo/vela@0.9.3` global bundle in `dist/assets/vela.global.min.js`), including native crosshair, drawing toolbar, indicators and NOTICE attribution (enabled by default).
- **feat(gains):** verified **Gains Network** market-data integration (`dist/gains-adapter.js`, mirrored in `packages/openfund-gains-adapter/`): 488 live markets from `GET /v1/arbitrum/markets`, mark/index prices from `GET /prices` + the `wss://api.gains.trade/v1/arbitrum/ws` prices channel (auto-reconnect, staleness watchdog), and OHLC candles from `GET /markets/{sym}/candles` for 1m/5m/15m/30m/1h/4h/1d (**1w is not supported by Gains — verified — and is not offered**).
- **feat(charts):** `dist/vela-bridge.js` (mirrored in `packages/openfund-charts/`) mounts Vela with the Gains provider, exposing `setSymbol / setTimeframe / setTheme / resize / destroy`.
- **feat(terminal):** market selector now browses the 488 real Gains markets with category chips + search + watchlist stars; market stats show the real mark, index, 24h high/low/change (from real candles), real hourly funding and the real per-market max leverage (BTC 200×, XAU 4× …) which now clamps the leverage control.
- **feat(terminal):** the simulated demo trading engine now executes against **real Gains marks**; fees/margin/liquidation remain simplified demo assumptions (documented in the on-page "Demo assumptions" dialog). Volume, open interest, order-book depth and trade tape are **not provided by the Gains API** and are either shown as `—` or clearly labelled as simulated presentation views.
- Dark/light themes (persisted) and FA/EN bilingual UI now cover the Vela chart too (`chart.setTheme`, `chart.setLocale` best-effort).
- chore: removed temporary test/screenshot files from `dist/`.


### Documentation and structure
- Define modular Openfund application and adapter boundaries without migrating existing frontend files.
- Establish common agent collaboration rules, integration specifications, feature status, roadmap, security guidance and PR template.

### Existing repository baseline
- Landing/account and terminal prototypes exist in `dist/`.
- Charting dependency installation has been reported, but functional Vela embedding has not been verified.
- Gains SDK and testnet integration have not been verified as operational.
